          From Curiosity to Code: My Tech Story So Far When I began my Computer
          Engineering degree, I was deeply curious about how websites worked
          behind the scenes. That curiosity turned into late nights exploring
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and eventually diving into frameworks like
          React and backend tools like Node.js. My passion evolved through
          personal projects, challenges, and hands-on learning—especially
          through my Full Stack Web Development Internship at IIT Jammu, where I
          contributed to real-world applications that helped monitor systems and
          visualize data effectively. This journey is just beginning, and I’m
          excited for every step ahead.

          When Theory Became Practice Operating System concepts can feel
          abstract until you apply them. That’s exactly what I did with my
          project on the NRU (Not Recently Used) Page Replacement Algorithm.
          Written in C++, it simulates how the operating system manages memory
          and makes decisions about which pages to replace. This project
          challenged me to think like a systems programmer and gave me a
          newfound appreciation for how computers manage resources efficiently.
          It’s one of my favorite ways of blending academics with real
          implementation.

          Turning User Needs into Tech Solutions Managing hostel room
          allocations manually can be messy and inefficient. So I built a Hostel
          Accommodation System — a C++ project focused on organizing student
          information, automating room assignments, and ensuring clarity for
          both students and wardens. This taught me how important user-centered
          logic is and how clean data flow leads to better systems. It wasn’t
          just about writing code—it was about solving a practical problem,
          which made it deeply satisfying.

          A Real-World Dive into Full Stack Development Working as a full-stack
          web development intern at IIT Jammu was one of the most rewarding
          experiences in my tech journey. I worked with a team to build internal
          dashboards, learned best practices in version control, responsive
          design, and backend integration. More importantly, I understood the
          importance of clean code, teamwork, and scalable thinking. It wasn’t
          just about learning frameworks—it was about learning how to think like
          a developer in the real world.

          Getting Hands-On with Tech Simulations Recently, I completed three
          Deloitte Australia virtual job simulations through Forage: In Data
          Analytics, I used Tableau and Excel to classify and analyze datasets.
          In Tech Consulting, I designed a smart dashboard system. In
          Cybersecurity, I investigated threats and supported a client during a
          simulated cyber breach. These experiences broadened my perspective
          beyond coding—teaching me about data storytelling, secure systems, and
          strategic thinking. They aligned perfectly with my passion for
          impactful tech solutions and gave me a glimpse into diverse tech
          domains.
